# Guess-the-Number-Game

Python project simulating 'Guess the Number' game.
The user gets to choose between easy or hard level, wherein he gets a maximum of 5 attempts for hard level and 10 attempts for an easy level.

A random number is chosen by the computer, and the player needs to guess the number, while satisfying the maximum attempts constraint.

At every guess, the player gets to know whether his guess was too high, too low, or if he guessed correctly.
